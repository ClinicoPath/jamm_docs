`r keywords("Path Diagram, Mediation, mediated moderation, moderated mediation, conditional mediation")`

In this page we show how to set up some mediation models without interactions. For models with interactions (conditional mediation, moderated mediation, etc) see `r link_pages(nickname="moderator_building")`.

# Simple mediation

To set up a simple mediation model, simply define one dependent variable, one independent variable and one mediator.

jAMM will define the models for you, as shown in the model info table.

# Categorical independent variables

The same logic applies for categorical independent variables. 

<img src="models/m2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

However, for categorical independent variables, the path diagram shows only one box for the IV, even though the estimation requires dummies (contrast variables) to estimate the effects. This is signaled in the notes.

<img src="models/m2_2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

Thus, since `fact1` variable has 4 groups,  in the results we will find three mediated effects, one for the contrast variable `fact11`, one for `fact12`, and one for `fact11`. 

<img src="models/m2_3.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

# Multiple independent variables

You can add as many independent variables as you need, the model is updated, by default, accordingly with the simple rule that each IV is mediatated by the mediator. 

<img src="models/m3.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

Nonetheless, one may have in mind a different model (not necessarily sensible in all applications). Assume we want the mediated effects of `x1` and `x2` through `m1`, but we want the effects on `y` (and only them) to be computed after partializing `x3`. First, we go to `Mediators models` and remove the effect of `x3` from the list of predictors. In doing so, the jAMM removes `x3` also from the `Full model`. We go there and re-include `x3` in the list of predictors. So we obtain the model we had in mind.  

<img src="models/m4.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

Notice the green path. That path is not estimated, but jAMM suggests to estimate it. That is because the model we just set up is not complete in terms of `x3` mediation (recall that jAMM assumes you want to estimate mediation models). 

<img src="models/m4.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

If seeing the suggested paths disturb you, you can suppress them in the `Mediation options` tab.

# Multiple mediators

## Parallel mediators

By defining two or more variables as mediators in the variables input panel, we obtain a parallel mediators model by default.

<img src="models/m5.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

You can put as many mediators as you want

<img src="models/m6.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

## Mediators chains

Several mediation models require building some sort of mediators chain. For instance, we can have that variable `x` is measured 4 times,and we want to see if `x1` affects `x2`, `x2` affects `x3`, and `x3` affects `x4`. To build such a model, first we select `x1` as the independent variable (it is the only exogenous variable in the model), `x2` and `x3` as mediators and `x4` as dependent variable.

<img src="models/m7_1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

While we do so, jAMM builds a parallel mediators model (the default), but we ignore it and move on to change that. In fact, as compared with a parallel mediators model, the model we have in mind requires also that `x2` be a predictor of `x3`. We go to `Mediators models` tab and add `x2` in the field *Mediator=x3*. There we have it.

<img src="models/m7.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

## Multi-layer model

Assume you have `x1` as independent, that influences `x2` and `x3`, that in turn effect `y` through `m1`. We can think of this model as a multi-layer model in terms of layers of mediators: first the `x2` and `x3` layer, then `m1` layer. To set it up, first we put all endogenous predictors in the mediators field and `x1` and `y` in the independent and dependent field, respectively.

<img src="models/m8_1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

Again, we should change the automatically created parallel mediators model. We should add the paths from `x2` and `x3` to `m1`. To do so we go to `Mediators models` tab and add `x2` and `x3` in the field *Mediator=m1*.

<img src="models/m8.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

Suprised by the ugly picture? Well, the model is correct but the picture can look better if one re-arranges the position of the terms. First, remove the mediators (jAMM does not like re-arranging terms already defined, so it is better to start anew). We want the last mediator `m1` to be in the center of the diagram, so we should put it as the second mediator of the list. Then we change the `Mediators models` as we did before. Here is the input: a bit better looking.

Here is the output.

# Multiple IV and multiple mediators

One can combine the multiple IVs and the multiple mediators models to better suit the research aims. By defining multiple IV and multiple mediators in the variale input tabs, one obtains, by default, a full parallel mediators model.

<img src="models/m9.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

Obviously, one can then change the structure of the model, for instance by making the mediators a chain of mediators, or by removing some path from one IV to one mediator.

<img src="models/m11.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

Notice that the previos model is not equivalent to two independent simple mediation models, because in the present model all the effects on the dependent variable `y` are computed keeping constant both independent variables. This feature is reminded by the notes of the path diagram.

<img src="models/m11_2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

# Mis-specified models

There are models that may make a lot of sense in general, but are not mediation models. These models will not be estimated by jAMM, because they cannot produce mediated effects (that are the effects jAMM requires).

The first example is a model without mediators effect. 

<img src="models/m12.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

In this model I removed the path from `m1` to `y` in the `Full model` tab. That creates a model in which the mediator has no role, and thus the path diagram shows a red path indicating that that path is required. It also signals the problem in the `Models info` table.

<img src="models/m12_2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

Another possible error is to have each mediator to predict all the other mediators. That would make the model recursive, and not a mediation model.

<img src="models/m13.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

jAMM warns you of the problem with a purple path in the diagram, and with some explanation in the `Models info` table.
