# State of the art

* It makes the path model
* It shows interactions in the path models
* It makes checks for coherence of the model
* It makes suggestions toward more coherent models
* Automatically guesses which mediation model is more likely to be needed
* Custom models from UI
* It estimates the model coefficients
* Simple mediational effects (estimated at different levels of moderators)
 

# Not implemented

* Interactions among moderators of moderators (not really high priority)
* Rigorous checks for weired and complex models
